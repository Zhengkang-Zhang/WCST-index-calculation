## What's the script's function?

* this script "demographic.Rmd" is used for our split-half estimates on a Chinese dataset  of our own.
* the script generates several table and figures that are used in our unpublished manuscript. Once published we will put the link here.

## Something to know.

* Dataset: the WCST dataset we used here comes from our WCST experiment, which is not supllied here.
