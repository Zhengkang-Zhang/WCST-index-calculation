# WCST index calculation on our dataset



## What's the script's function?

* this script "demographic.Rmd" is used for our split-half estimates on a Chinese dataset  of our own.
* the script generates several table and figures that are used in our unpublished manuscript. Once published we will put the link here.

## Something to know.

* Dataset: the WCST dataset we used here comes from our WCST experiment and can be downloaded from [Card Sorting Task Performance in a Community Sample of Young and Elderly Adults (scidb.cn)](https://www.scidb.cn/en/detail?dataSetId=92bf888e67cb4c55924a65d29283cf2a) . Index calculation would be convenient based on our data and script.

* Check the "demographic.nb.html" to scan what we've done.
