# WCST index calculation on Teodora's dataset



## What's these scripts' function?

* "wcst_index_calculate_Teodora.R" is used to calculate the index and split-half estimates on Teodora's dataset
* "graph_split_half_Teodora.Rmd" is used to visualize the split-half estimates results. We provided "graph_split_half_Teodora.pdf" for a quick scan.

## Something to know.

* Dataset: the WCST dataset we used here comes from a dataset that is not published yet.
